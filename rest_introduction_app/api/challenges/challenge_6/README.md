It is 1959. You are a student of the Ural Polytechnical Institute. You've planned an expedition with 9 of your friends.

The goal of the expedition is to reach Otorten Mountain from Ivdel (Ивдель), a town at the centre of the northern province of Sverdlovsk Oblast.
The expedition is named for the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 

It is an "Extraordinary" Congress, timed so that Khrushchev try to consolidate his power over rivals after the attempted coup of the Anti-Party Group in 1957. 
The Seven-Year Plan of economic development is adopted.

### Expedition plan

It would require some necessary equipment you need to bring with you.
You have a backpack and pockets where you can keep items.
